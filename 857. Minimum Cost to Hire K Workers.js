// There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].

// Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

// Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
// Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
// Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.



// Example 1:

// Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
// Output: 105.00000
// Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
// Example 2:

// Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
// Output: 30.66667
// Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately.

// FAQ:
// Question: "However, it is possible that current worker has the highest quality, so you removed his quality in the last step, which leads to the problem that you are "using his ratio without him".
// Answer: It doesn't matter. The same group will be calculated earlier with smaller ratio.
// And it doesn't obey my logic here: For a given ratio of wage/quality, find minimum total wage of K workers.
