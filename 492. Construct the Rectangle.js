// For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length X and width Y satisfy the following requirements:

// 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

// 2. The width Y should not be larger than the length X, which means X >= Y.

// 3. The difference between length X and width Y should be as small as possible.
// You need to output the length X and the width Y of the web page you designed in sequence.
