// Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

// You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
// After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
// Example:

// Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
// Output: 3 
// Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
