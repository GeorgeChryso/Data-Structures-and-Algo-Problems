// All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

// A,C,G,T
// intuition: 
// I can reperesent each of my letters with 4 states, 00, 01,10,11
// so every 10 letter combination will become a sequence of 20 bits
// slide the window of 10 letters, create the appropriate bit combination, store in a set and If I come across a seen element, add it to the result object
