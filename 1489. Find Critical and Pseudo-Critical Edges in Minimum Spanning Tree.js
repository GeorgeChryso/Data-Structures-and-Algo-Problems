// Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes fromi and toi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

// Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the given graph. An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. A pseudo-critical edge, on the other hand, is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

// Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

// Potential solution

// Kruskal=>find MST's cost =>ElogE+ElogV
// Knapsack=>number of ways to reach  said cost=>E**2
// recursion=>generate all possible combinations of edges that reach that cost
// Unionfind=> check if said combinations are actually spanning the whole tree
// Process which nodes appear in every MST with the different combination of edges 
var findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges = function(n, edges) {

//alternative: 
// Kruskal's for MST's cost
// for every edge
//  
//  rerun Kruskal's without edge and see if cost grows
//      if(it's bigger)=>critical edge (belongs to every MST)
//      else{
//   rerun Kruskal's but with said edge preaccepted to the solution
//  (pre accepted to the MST group), if the cost doesnt change its a 
//     non critical (belongs to some MSTS)
