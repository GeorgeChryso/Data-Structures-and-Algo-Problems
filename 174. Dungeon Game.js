// The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a A. The A consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the A to rescue the princess.

// The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

// Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).

// In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
