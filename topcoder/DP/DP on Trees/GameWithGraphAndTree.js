 Clearly, we should consider all possible submapping of all subtrees on all vertex-subsets of the graph. The number of these submapping is huge, so we have to determine which properties of these submappings are important for extending the mapping. It turns out that these properties are:
1. Subtree denoted by its root vertex v. Necessary to check the outgoing edge mapping later.
2. Vertex of graph p which is the image of v. Again: necessary to check the mapping of added edge.
3. The full image of v-subtree in graph - set s of already mapped vertices in graph. Necessary to maintain bijectivity of mapping.
Therefore we define state domain (v,p,s)->GR. GR is number of submappings with the properties we are interested in.

To combine results of sons in tree we need to run another "internal" DP.
     Remember that internal DP is local for each vertex v of the tree. 
        The first parameter will be number of sons already merged - this is quite standard.
        Also we'll use additional parameters p and s inside. 
        The state domain is (k,p,s)->IR where IR is the number of submappings of partial v-subtree on graph with properties:
        1. The vertex v and subtrees corresponding to its first k sons are being mapped (called domain).
        2. Image of v is vertex p in graph.
        3. The full image of mapping considered is s - subset of already used vertices.
The transition of this internal DP is defined by adding one subtree corresponding to k-th son to the domain of mapping. For example, if w is the k-th son, then we add global state GR[w,q,t] to internal state IR[k,p,s] and get internal state IR[k+1,p,s+t]. Here we must check that there is an edge p-q in the graph and that sets s and t have no common elements. The combinations considered in GR[w,q,t] and IR[k,p,s] are independent, so we can just add their product to the destination state. The answer of internal DP is IR[sk,p,s] which is stored as a result GR[k,p,s] of global DP.
This is correct solution of this problem. Unfortunately, it runs in O(4^N * N^3) if implemented like it is in the code below. Of course it gets TL. You need to optimize the solution even further to achieve the required performance. The recipe "Optimizing DP solution" describes how to get this solution accepted.
