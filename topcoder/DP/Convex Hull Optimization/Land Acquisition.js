// Problem 1: Land Acquisition [Paul Christiano, 2007]

// Farmer John is considering buying more land for the farm and has
// his eye on N (1 <= N <= 50,000) additional rectangular plots, each
// with integer dimensions (1 <= width_i <= 1,000,000; 1 <= length_i
// <= 1,000,000).

// If FJ wants to buy a single piece of land, the cost is $1/square
// unit, but savings are available for large purchases. He can buy
// any number of plots of land for a price in dollars that is the width
// of the widest plot times the length of the longest plot. Of course,
// land plots cannot be rotated, i.e., if Farmer John buys a 3x5 plot
// and a 5x3 plot in a group, he will pay 5x5=25.

// FJ wants to grow his farm as much as possible and desires all the
// plots of land. Being both clever and frugal, it dawns on him that
// he can purchase the land in successive groups, cleverly minimizing
// the total cost by grouping various plots that have advantageous
// width or length values.

// Given the number of plots for sale and the dimensions of each,
// determine the minimum amount for which Farmer John can purchase all

// PROBLEM NAME: acquire

// INPUT FORMAT:

// * Line 1: A single integer: N

// * Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes plot i with two space-separated
//         integers: width_i and length_i

// SAMPLE INPUT:

// 4
// 100 1
// 15 15
// 20 5
// 1 100

// INPUT DETAILS:

// There are four plots for sale with dimensions as shown.

// OUTPUT FORMAT:

// * Line 1: The minimum amount necessary to buy all the plots.

// SAMPLE OUTPUT:

// 500

// OUTPUT DETAILS:

// The first group contains a 100x1 plot and costs 100. The next group
// contains a 1x100 plot and costs 100. The last group contains both the 20x5
// plot and the 15x15 plot and costs 300. The total cost is 500, which is
// minimal.
