    Let us denote with f(x) the minimum weight of MST that has x edges

    then necessarily, f(x+1)-f(x)>=f(x)-f(x-1), because for f(x) to be created, an extra white edge was added to f(x-1).
    But not just any edge, the minimum white edge that was not a part of f(x-1) was added. Same goes for the creation
     of f(x+1). A white edge was added, the minimum white edge not in f(x). That minimum white edge is necessarily bigger, than the one which was added to f(x-1). Hence the inequality holds. 

    So now I want to minimize f(x)+ px given some value p.
