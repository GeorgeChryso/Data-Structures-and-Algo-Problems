// "4Blocks" is a two player cooperative game played on a special board. The board is a grid composed of 1x1 square cells. There are two different kinds of blocks: '1' blocks and '4' blocks. '1' blocks are 1x1, and '4' blocks are 2x2:






// You must place blocks on the board so that their sides are aligned to the grid lines and no two blocks overlap. The final score is the sum of the values in each cell. '1' blocks are worth 1 point, and '4' blocks are worth 16 points because they cover 4 cells and each cell is worth 4 points.



// Your friend has taken his turn and placed a number of '1' blocks on the board. The current nexturation is given in the String[] grid. The j-th character of the i-th element of grid is '.' if the cell at row i, column j is empty, and '1' if your friend placed a '1' block in that cell. It is now your turn, and you can place any number of '1' or '4' blocks on the board, but you cannot remove any of the blocks that have already been placed. Return the maximum score that can be achieved. For example, the following images show one possible starting state, and the optimal placement of blocks from that state:







// The final score would be 4*16 + 6*1 = 70.

                                contains some 1s (4x4s) which extend to the "next" mask?
                                example                                                *(next|(next<<1))
                                   prev next        So, prev was already converted to its ACTUAL* occupancy
                                    0     1         represntation. That means that those two ones extend to 
                                    0     0         the "next" mask, and should therefore not be counted
                                    1     0         cos they were countd on the previous call of rec.
                                    1     0         So I will count the one the bottom, (the remaining 0)
                                    0     0 <==== this one , because it isnt occupied by any previous squares or
                                                    current 4x4s squares and will therefore be occupied by just a 1x1 square that needs to be accounted for.
