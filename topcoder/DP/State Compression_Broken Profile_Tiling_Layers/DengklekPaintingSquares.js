// // Mr. Dengklek lives in the Kingdom of Ducks, where humans and ducks live together in peace and harmony.



// // One day, the queen of the kingdom challenged Mr. Dengklek with a perplexing puzzle: she gave Mr. Dengklek an N Ã— M board made of wood that consists of N*M squares. She then asked Mr. Dengklek to paint the squares according to these rules:



// // Each square must be either colored or empty.
// // Each colored square must have an even number of adjacent colored squares. Two squares are adjacent if they share a side.

// Each colored square must have an even number of adjacent colored squares. Two squares are adjacent if they share a side.
// For example, here is one valid solution for N=4, M=7:


// Of course, finding one solution to the puzzle is easy: we do not color anything. Instead, the queen asked Mr. Dengklek a much harder question: to count all valid solutions of the puzzle. Help Mr. Dengklek count the solutions and return the result modulo 1,000,000,007. Two solutions are different if there is a square that is colored in one solution and not colored in the other solution.

//theoretical approach:
// 1. Go through each row.
// 2. Try every possible combination for each row.
// 3. For each combination, see if it is valid by looking at the shape of the previous row, which will be given in ternary number.


// add extra conditions to the profile 
// that increases its base from 2->3 
let numSolutions=(n,m)=>{

    // 0 : If (i)th square is not colored.
    // 1 : If (i)th square is colored, and has odd number of neighbors.
    // 2 : If (i)th square is colored, and has even number of neighbors.
    // so any profile can be written as a base 3 integer with length m
