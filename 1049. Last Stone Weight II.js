// We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

// Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

// If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
// If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
// At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)

// essentially This problem asks me to place my elements into two groups, 
// one with + before them and one with -. Essentially forming my final sum (result). 
// sum(P)-sum(N)=result
// total=result +sum(N)
// sum(N)=total-result

// ok I think i got an optimization.
// Essentially, Since my result= sumP-sumN ,where P and N are a partition of my array, I need to minimize my result
// <=> sumP+sumN-sumN+sumN
// <=> sumA-2sumN=result 
// <=> minimize(result)=minimize(sumA-2sumN)=min|sumA-2sumN| , so i just need to minimize the sum of a subgroup in order for me to get the minimized result 

// translates to a knapsack problem where I need to find every possible sum I can get using all my items
// less runtime less space
