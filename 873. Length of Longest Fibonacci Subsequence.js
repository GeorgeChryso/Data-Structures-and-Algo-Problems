// A sequence X_1, X_2, ..., X_n is fibonacci-like if:

//  n >= 3

// X_i + X_{i+1} = X_{i+2} for all i + 2 <= n


// Given a strictly increasing array A of positive integers forming a sequence, find the length of the longest fibonacci-like subsequence of A.  If one does not exist, return 0.

// (Recall that a subsequence is derived from another sequence A by deleting any number of elements (including none) from A, without changing the order of the remaining elements.  For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].)

// Example 1:

// Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8]
