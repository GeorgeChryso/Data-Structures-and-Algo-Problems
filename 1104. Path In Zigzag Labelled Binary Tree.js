// In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.

// In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.


// Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that label.
