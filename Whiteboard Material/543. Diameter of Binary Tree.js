// Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.


// dfs solution

// Any path, can be written as two arrows starting from a node. The first arrow L starts on its left child, and the second one R on its right.
// if i know the maximum length arrows for each child, then the best path has length L+R+1

//Time Complexity: O(N). We visit every node once.

//Space Complexity: O(N), the size of our implicit call stack during our depth-first search.
